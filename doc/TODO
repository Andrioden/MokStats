HIGH PRI
------------------
- Can register new matches through mobile, idea: auth using a predined password, to avoid having to login to django.

MEDIUM PRI
------------------
- Under the div stats for rounds that has statistics that never will change (like most points in spades): Change to who has the "max/min points" the most amount of times.
- Add a last backup date page, which indicates if the backup function is running by green/red something.

LOW PRI
------------------
- Filter player stats by period/year.
- Who has the worst stats for the different round the most times.

PERFORMANCE / INTERNAL STUFF
----------------------------
- Investigate static files pattern thingy in urls
- Can ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["127.0.0.1", "localhost"] be used to set debug=false? Investigate.
- Add field to PlayerResult: solitaire_sum, summarize the solitaire values "on save" to simplify everything in regard to it.
- Add field to PlayerResult: rating earned, can then check best earned rating and simplify rating earned calculations.
