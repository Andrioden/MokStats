- Filter player stats by period/year.
- List all worst spades, queens, etc games.
- Add a last backup date page, which indicates if the backup function is running by green/red something.
- Show only active players at rating progression page, or maybe last active players.
- Under the div stats for rounds that has statistics that never will change (like most points in spades): Change to who has the "max/min points" the most amount of times.
