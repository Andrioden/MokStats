A web page that generates statistics and graphs for our traditional cabin game MÃ¸kkis, which is a 6athlon card game.

Live page: http://andresh.nerdvana.tihlde.org:20000/mokstats/

The web page is developed using the python web framework Django. It also contains small amounts of JavaScript code, mostly to generate graphs with jqPlot (http://www.jqplot.com/).
